            <h3>Simulation of Heat Transfer in Reciprocating Compressors</h3>
            <p>
                My thesis involved the application of various mathematical models to heat transfer within reciprocating-piston compressors, between working fluid and compressor walls. The work is relevant to the energy transition due to its applicability in hydrogen compression, for its storage and use in vehicles. A literature overview is presented along with equations from various authors, implemented in MATLAB to compare simulation results. It is ascertained that heat transfer requires consideration, although its effect is small compared to the compression power.

            <h3>Energy Strategy Report</h3>
            <p>
                I designed a heat network running simulations in MATLAB to evaluate district energy needs for 8 mixed-use buildings, applying schedules for occupation, domestic hot water and electrical appliance usage, as well as building geometry and weather data. An appropriate HVAC system was selected, and substations were designed and sized. Renewable energy was integrated through photovoltaics, with Life Cycle Analysis and Environmental Impact Assessments. Thermal plume evolution in the ground was analysed to monitor consequences of groundwater loops. Resilience to climate change was assessed considering 2050 predicted weather data.
              The result was a district with photovoltaic electricity implemented, although production was not enough to cover annual loads. Thus, a positive energy district was not achieved, although surplus renewable electricity could be produced for some of the year. Emissions throughout the life cycle of the district were not zero either, although materials selection could reduce carbon footprint. Although the desired objectives were not reached, the district performed well, being able to export electricity whilst maintaining indoor comfort levels through the use of space heating and cooling, district hot water, and user appliances. Electricity loads not covered by solar panels were met by importing electricity from the grid.

            <h3>Sizing of an Off-Grid PV Plant in Reghinera</h3>
            <p>
                The project aim was to design a stand-alone photovoltaic plant with battery energy storage for residential use. Electricity demand was to be met on an hourly basis over the plant's lifetime. PVGIS was used in determining irradiation on the panels, with PVsyst being used to design module and inverter arrangement. The battery was sized to cover loads, and optimal design considered lowest Levelised Cost of Energy.
              It is ascertained that although the cost of electricity is higher for the designed stand-alone configuration, competitiveness could be enhanced resizing the battery and connecting to the national grid.

            <h3>Wind Power Plant: Cerignola Veneta Sud</h3>
            <p> 
                A case study is performed on a wind farm in Cerignola, Italy, to assess whether it is profitable. An overview is presented on the Italian wind market, including electricity market price fluctuation and regulatory frameworks. Operational performance of the plant is assessed from wind data. An economic analysis is performed considering a 2018 case prior to the energy crisis, a 2022 case, and a 2024 case including sensitivity analysis on inflation and operating costs.
              It is determined that the investment is profitable for the 2018 and 2024 cases, whereas it is not so in 2022, due to the energy crisis.

            <h3>Bioplastic Food Packaging from Waste Whey</h3>
            <p> 
              A co-polymerisation reaction is selected to convert waste liquid whey to bioplastic for use in food packaging, sourced locally for a production plant in Somerset, United Kingdom.
              The use of waste whey as the input to this process prevents use of a first-generation feedstock for bioplastic production, associated with competition with the food industry. In comparison to other methods of producing bioplastics from waste whey, such as through fermentation, this is a simpler process with fewer process units. The process effectively uses waste that smaller dairy farms may have otherwise had issues with disposal and provides jobs to stimulate the local economy. In comparison to conventional plastics, the use of fossil fuels is reduced, with 30% of the plastic being non-fossil fuel based. Ambient temperatures and pressures throughout the majority of the process provide an inherently safe design, but the many chemicals involved pose the greatest risks. With the number of batches and selling product price considered, the project does not break even throughout the plant lifetime, indicating that it is not economically feasible unless cheaper chemicals are used, more batches are carried out or the product is sold at a higher price. Therefore, to further improve this process, more research is required to determine a safer, more sustainable alternative to the co-polymer PEGMA, as this corresponds to many of the environmental impacts and hazards of the process, and is responsible for a large proportion of the OPEX for the process. The biodegradability and the properties of the product also require further investigation, and the design of the units further refined to ensure optimum operation of the plant.

            <h3>Bioplastic Food Packaging from Waste Whey: Drum Dryer</h3>
            <p>
                Following the group design project on bioplastic production, I performed an individual design on the drum dryer used to dry the polymer. As the group project was not profitable, the individual work seeked to reduce costs. Unit design involved equipment selection, Process Flow Diagrams, material and energy balances, MATLAB implementation, and unit optimisation. Mechanical design involved material selection, engineering drawings and P&ID and control. HAZID and HAZOP were performed, along with procedure, operation and maintenance. Final design temperature and pressure were lower than initial values proposed in the group work, thus contributing to lower costs, environmental impacts and hazards.

            <h3>Sustainable Energy Storage</h3>
            <p>
               The aim of the project is to develop an uninterruptable low-cost energy supply for a data centre in Honoka’a, Hawaii. It consists of a renewable energy storage system, using energy from wind farms when there is a surplus, to store energy for use when the wind is low. The project involves assessing a means by which energy can be stored for peak shaving, and selecting one of these based on cost, environmental impact, and benefit for the local community.
            A green hydrogen energy storage system is selected based on a triple bottom line assessment, chosen instead of hydropower for financial, environmental, and social reasons.
